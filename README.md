# Web Development - Final Project

This is the repository of the final project in the Web Development course I'm following in the Polytechnic University of Tirana while studying Computer Engineering.

## Create the database
![DB schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aziflaj/upt-web-dev/master/docs/eer_diagram.png)

The MySQL database schema shown above is created using [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/). You can access the Workbench generated files in the `docs/` directory. You can create the database by running the [`work_portal.sql`](https://github.com/aziflaj/upt-web-dev/blob/master/work_portal.sql) file.
